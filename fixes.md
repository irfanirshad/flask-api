# FIX ME!
### check_dns_propogation() method in api.dns
What? Needs to be implemented 
Problem: Dnspython library support 
Fix: Different library(dns-crawler) or subprocess command or a workaround?
Any Affects: Changes need to be made to the test implementation


### Python version
What? Doesnt run due to a regex error
Why? Python 3.9 issue 
Fix: Use Python 3.6 env always in our docker or conda 
Any Affects: None
